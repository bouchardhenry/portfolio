      "A visual identity and digital presence for Madreema Foundation — an institution devoted to art, education, and remembrance. Defined by clarity, restraint, and considered silence.",
    challenge:
      "To create an identity of permanence without symbolism, and elegance without excess. The foundation required an expression that could hold meaning quietly, across print, space, and screen.",
    solution:
      "A handwritten logotype balanced by an editorial typographic system and generous white space. The website was designed as a calm, structured surface — allowing art, purpose, and content to exist without interruption.",

    description:
      "Svea Vaccin is Scandinavia's largest vaccination chain — 43 clinics, always drop-in, 30 years of expertise. The redesign made that confidence felt from the first click.",
    challenge:
      "A network this strong deserved a site that matched it. The old experience buried the essentials — patients arrived knowing what they needed and left without the information to act.",
    solution:
      "A lean, direct interface built around clarity. Find your vaccine, locate your nearest clinic, walk in. Human in tone, clinical in precision. Zero dead ends.",

    description:
      "A proposed heuristic evaluation and redesign of the Prisjakt price comparison app — identifying usability failures across navigation, homepage, and list views, then resolving them through lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes I designed.",
    challenge:
      "The app suffered from poor brand recognition, cluttered information hierarchy, and friction-heavy interactions. Users took 14 seconds to locate categories — seven times longer than on competing platforms. The list feature obscured core conventions and made error recovery unnecessarily complex.",
    solution:
      "Applying Nielsen & Molich's 10 heuristics, I proposed a redesign of the homepage, mega-menu navigation, and favorites list. The proposition reintroduced Prisjakt's visual identity, elevated the search function, clarified the scanner feature, and reduced list management to two clicks.",

    challenge:
      "Mental health products often default to either cold medical aesthetics or overly soft pastels. Halo Mind needed a third path — warm, intelligent, and genuinely human.",
    solution:

      "A Collective is a co-working studio and community platform created to bring people together. With members from diverse backgrounds and a wide range of expertise, everyone can find their own place within the community — whether you are looking for new collaborators, lifelong friends, or someone to exchange ideas with.",
    challenge:
      "The challenge was to build a brand and digital presence that reflects the diversity of the community while remaining clear and cohesive. The platform needed to communicate both professionalism and warmth — a space for networking, co-working, and activities such as yoga — while also standing out on social media.",
    solution:
      "We developed an inclusive and dynamic visual identity that mirrors the breadth of people and skills within A Collective. The digital platform was designed to feel alive and welcoming, with a strong focus on community and interaction. Through a clear social media strategy, we highlight the studio’s unique concept and strengthen its online presence to attract new members.",

    "A retro-styled Pokémon encyclopedia I built showcasing all 151 original Generation 1 Pokémon. Combining Game Boy nostalgia with modern web development — powered by React and the PokéAPI.",
    challenge:
      "Translating a childhood aesthetic into a fully functional, responsive web app without losing the retro feel. The design had to evoke pixel-era gaming while remaining clean and navigable across all screen sizes.",
      solution:
      "I built the app with React and React Router, fetching live data from the PokéAPI. The interface uses Press Start 2P typography, animated sprites, and Game Boy-inspired card layouts. A responsive grid adapts from 5 columns on desktop down to 2 on mobile, and easter eggs — a shiny Mew in the footer, a spinning Masterball — reward curious users.",
