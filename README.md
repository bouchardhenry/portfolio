## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v18 or later recommended).

### 2. Install dependencies

Clone the repository, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all packages listed in `package.json`, including React and React Router.

### 3. Install React Router (if starting fresh)

If you are setting up a new project and need to add React Router manually:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

This project uses version `6.3`. To install that specific version:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@6.3
```

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
